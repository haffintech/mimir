Then `cd` into the project directory after cloning.\
Lastly, run `npm install`. This will download all needed node-modules. If successful, a `node_modules`-directory will appear

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
